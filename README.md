❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using Logistic Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart attack based on health-related parameters. Logistic Regression is widely used for binary classification problems, making it a great choice for predicting whether a person is at risk (1) or not (0).

🎯 Objectives

Preprocess and analyze medical data related to heart disease.

Apply Logistic Regression for binary classification.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Provide insights into risk factors influencing heart disease.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains 14 features and 1 target column related to patient health indicators.

Column	Description
age	Age of the patient (in years)
sex	Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp	Chest Pain Type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
trestbps	Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol	Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
fbs	Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl) (1 = true, 0 = false)
restecg	Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy)
thalach	Maximum heart rate achieved
exang	Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
ca	Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal	Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
target	0 = No heart disease (Healthy), 1 = Heart disease (Risk of heart attack)
